## Abstract
```The stock market continues to play a crucial role in the global economy, providing a platform for individuals to invest their savings and potentially earn returns. Despite recent fluctuations, the stock market remains a key indicator of the overall health and stability of a nation's economy, and it continues to shape the economic landscape and investment decisions of both individuals and organizations. Therefore, financial analysts use various types of analysis for stock evaluation and decision-making, however, our focus is on both “Technical Analysis” and “News-based Analysis”. By definition, technical analysis uses charts and other statistical analyses to identify patterns in a stock's price and volume data to predict future price movements while news-based analysis involves evaluating the potential impact of news events, such as earnings reports, product launches, regulatory changes, and other relevant events, on a company's stock price and overall financial performance. AI has the potential to revolutionize the stock market prediction process in which a lot of methods that use technical analysis or news-based analysis have been evaluated whereas combining both approaches and representing them in a knowledge graph has not been yet extensively explored. Consequently, we have chosen Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) which can mimic human behavior and are particularly well-suited to tasks that involve modeling relationships and interactions between entities in a graph, such as those found in financial markets. However, it is worth mentioning that the stock market is a complex system, and making predictions about it is a challenging task. Hence, we are working to figure out the effectiveness of the mentioned approach.```
